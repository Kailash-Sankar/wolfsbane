I write code for a living and I love what I do.

I have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. While in college I learned C and C++, did my projects on .net and android.
After graduation, I started on a path to become a web developer.
<br/><br/>
I began at the backend with perl, CGI framework and MSSQL. Then I picked up Catalyst framework and the usual flavours of frontend - HTML, CSS and Javscript.
After two years in perl I realized it's time to pick up another language, Python seemed like an obvious choice.

I've build apps in Django, MySQL along with Angular.js, Material design lite and Bootstrap.
<br/><br/>

Next I switched my focus on to javascript. I wrote a few plugins in js and started looking in to Node.js.
I had quite a bit of fun with it that I decided to build this new protfolio in Node.js to replace my rather heavy perl catalyst website and blog.

I like to learn new things and occasionally write about them on my blog.
